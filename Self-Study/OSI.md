# OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement standard protocols in networking. It divides the network communication process into seven distinct layers, each with specific functions and protocols. Here's an overview of the OSI model, its layers, and their respective functions:

## OSI Model Layers

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
    - **Function**: Responsible for the physical connection between devices. It handles the transmission and reception of raw binary data over a physical medium (such as cables, switches, and other hardware).
    - **Key Concepts**: Bit rate control, physical connections, voltage levels, and data rates.

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
    - **Function**: Ensures reliable data transfer across a physical network link. It provides error detection and correction and handles frame synchronization.
    - **Key Concepts**: MAC addresses, frames, switches, error detection (e.g., CRC), and protocols like Ethernet.

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
    - **Function**: Manages the delivery of packets across multiple networks (routing). It determines the best physical path for data to travel from source to destination.
    - **Key Concepts**: IP addresses, routing, packets, routers, and protocols like IP (IPv4/IPv6).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
    - **Function**: Provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers. It handles error recovery, flow control, and ensures complete data transfer.
    - **Key Concepts**: TCP/UDP, ports, segments, and data flow management.

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
    - **Function**: Manages sessions between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between applications.
    - **Key Concepts**: Session establishment, maintenance, and termination; synchronization.

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
    - **Function**: Translates data between the application layer and the network. It handles data encryption, compression, and translation between different data formats.
    - **Key Concepts**: Data encryption/decryption, data compression, and data translation.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
    - **Function**: Provides network services directly to user applications. It facilitates user interactions with the network.
    - **Key Concepts**: Protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and applications like web browsers and email clients.
